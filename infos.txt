Welcome to Gravity Brick Breaker! This is more than your usual Brick Breaker game, featuring shiny Bonuses and incredible level designs. The instructions are simple: click the start button, and you enter level 1 with 3 lives. 
There are 3 levels to be completed. When you win (or die), your score will be compared to the current high-scores and hopefully added to the list! 
Simply move the paddle to hit the ball when it falls back down. Some bricks contain bonuses whose motion might surprise you! The bricks' color indicates their resistance.
 Enjoy.
